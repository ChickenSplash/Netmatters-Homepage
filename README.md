Netmatters Mirror Website

Recommendation to run locally:
- Import netmatters-website.sql (I would use TablePlus).
- Run Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
- Set the Apache config file to run the server on the root of the project.
- .env.example is to be renamed to .env, the value of each line corresponds to the respective connection detail to the database
