Recommendation to run locally:
- Create a new database and import `netmatters-website.sql` using TablePlus.
- Run Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
- Set the Apache config file to run the server on the root of the project.
- `.env.example` is to be renamed to `.env`, the value of each line corresponds to the respective connection detail to the database
